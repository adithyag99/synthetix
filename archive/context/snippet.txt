Epsilon-Differential Privacy for
Healthcare AI:
A Mathematical Framework for Privacy-Preserving
Synthetic Data Generation

Healthcare stands at a critical inflection point. The industry is poised to invest over $500 billion in AI
technologies by 2033, yet an estimated 60% of healthcare AI projects fail due to a single,
fundamental barrier: access to data.
The promise of AI in healthcare—from early disease detection to personalized treatment
plans—remains largely unrealized because patient data, protected by necessary privacy regulations
like HIPAA, cannot be safely shared, aggregated, or used for model training.
SynthetixData.ai has developed a breakthrough approach that resolves this paradox:
mathematically private synthetic healthcare data that preserves clinical utility while
providing provable privacy guarantees through epsilon-differential privacy.
Key Differentiators
• Mathematical Privacy Guarantees: Unlike statistical anonymization, our differential privacy
implementation provides quantifiable, provable privacy bounds (ε-differential privacy)
• Clinical Fidelity: Synthetic data preserves complex clinical relationships, temporal patterns,
and rare disease representations with 95%+ model accuracy preservation
• Regulatory Ready: Built for HIPAA compliance with comprehensive audit trails, privacy budget
tracking, and documentation for regulatory review
• Healthcare Native: Native FHIR R4 support, ICD-10/CPT code preservation, and deep
integration with healthcare data standards
