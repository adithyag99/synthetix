1. The Hero Section: The "Speed" & "Safety" ParadoxGoal: Address the "12-month delay" pain point immediately.Headline (H1): Accelerate Healthcare AI. Bypass the BAA Bottleneck.Sub-headline: Generate HIPAA-compliant, FDA-grade synthetic datasets in hours—not months. Replace risky de-identification with provable $\epsilon$-differential privacy. 111Primary Action (Modal Trigger):Button Text: [ Read the Technical Whitepaper ]Microcopy: Includes mathematical proofs and FDA validation pathways.Visual Asset (Right Side): The "Distribution Proof" Graph.Teal Curve (Synthetix) overlapping Gray Curve (Source).Caption: "Figure 1: 95% preservation of clinical correlations (AUC) with $\epsilon$=1.2 privacy budget." 2The Trust Bar (Bottom of Hero):[ HIPAA Compliant ] [ SOC 2 Type II ] [ FHIR R4 Native ] [ FDA Submission Ready ] 33332.
